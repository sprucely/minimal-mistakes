**Information Collection and Use**

The game Deflection does not collect any information. Period. That being said, it does make use of third-party libraries that may or may not collect identifying information. Of the libraries and APIs in use, the only ones I am aware of that may collect information are Google Play, Fabric and Crashlytics, all of which fall under Google's umbrella.

I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app, Crashlytics collects and transmits to its servers information called Log Data for the purpose of identifying the cause of a crash. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
